## README for run_analysis

Tidying data for Human Activity Recognition by Smartphone data (Course Project - Getting and Cleaning Data)

run_analysis works with data from the Human Activity Recognition research based on using Smartphone data.

This project fulfills the requirements for the Course Project in Getting and Cleaning Data

The R script (`run_analysis.R`)is designed so that if you have the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip in your working directory, the script will be able to complete the various tasks and return a text file with the summarised (means of each mean and standard deviation by student and activity).

More details on the data are available through http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

See `Codebook.txt` for an explanation of the variables, activities and the subjects (people) in the data.
